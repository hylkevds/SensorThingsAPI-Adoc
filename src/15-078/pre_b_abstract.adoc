== Abstract

The OGC SensorThings API provides an open, geospatial-enabled and unified way to interconnect the internet of things (iot) devices, data, and applications over the web. At a high level the OGC SensorThings API provides two main functionalities and each function is handled by a part. The two parts are the sensing part and the tasking part. The sensing part provides a standard way to manage and retrieve observations and metadata from heterogeneous iot sensor systems. The tasking part is planned as a future work activity and will be defined in a separate document as the part ii of the sensorthings api.
