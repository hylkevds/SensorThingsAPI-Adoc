[[introduction]]
=== Introduction

The SensorThings service interface provides interfaces for users to perform CRUD actions on resources through different HTTP methods. However, as many IoT devices are resource-constrained, handling a large number of communications may not be practical. This section describes how a SensorThings service can support executing multiple operations sent in a single HTTP request through the use of batch processing. This section covers both how batch operations are represented and processed. SensorThings batch request extension is adapted from [OData 4.0 Protocol 11.7]
and all subsections. The only difference is that the OData-Version header SHOULD be omitted in SensorThings. Readers are encouraged to read the OData specification section 11.7 before reading the examples below.


[[batch-processing]]
=== Batch-processing request

A batch request is represented as a Multipart MIME v1.0 message [RFC2046], a standard format allowing the representation of multiple parts, each of which may have a different content type, within a single request.

The example below shows a GUID as a boundary and example.org/v1.0/ for the URI of the service.

Batch requests are submitted as a single HTTP POST request to the batch endpoint of a service, located at the URL $batch relative to the service root (e.g., example.org/v1.0/$batch).

Note: In the example, request bodies are excluded in favor of English descriptions inside `<>` brackets to simplify the example.

[[batch-request-example]]
==== Batch request body example

The following example shows a Batch Request that contains the following operations in the order listed

* A query request
* Change Set that contains the following requests:
* Insert entity (with Content-ID = 1)
* Update request (with Content-ID = 2)
* A second query request

Note: For brevity, in the example, request bodies are excluded in favor of English descriptions inside <> brackets.

Note also that the two empty lines after the Host header of the GET request are necessary: the first is part of the GET request header; the second is the empty body of the GET request, followed by a CRLF according to [RFC2046].
