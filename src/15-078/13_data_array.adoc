|===

Similar to the SWE DataArray in the OGC SOS, SensorThings API also provides the support of dataArray (in addition to formatting every observation entity as a JSON object) to aggregate multiple Observation entities and reduce the request (e.g., POST) and response (e.g., GET) size. SensorThings mainly use dataArray in two scenarios: (1) get Observation entities in dataArray, and (2) create Observation entities with dataArray.


[[retrieve-observation-dataarray]]
=== Retrieve a Datastreamâ€™s Observation entities in dataArray

In SensorThings services, users are able to request for multiple Observation entities and format the entities in the dataArray format. When a SensorThings service returns a dataArray response, the service groups Observation entities by Datastream or MultiDatastream, which means the Observation entities that link to the same Datastream or the same MultiDatastream are aggregated in one dataArray.


==== Request

In order to request for dataArray, users must include the query option ``$resultFormat=dataArray``
when requesting Observation entities. For example, ``http://example.org/v1.0/Observations?$resultFormat=dataArray``.


==== Response

The response Observations in dataArray format contains the following properties.

[[create-observation-dataarray]]
=== Create Observation entities with dataArray

Besides creating Observation entities one by one with multiple HTTP POST requests, there is a need to create multiple Observation entities with a lighter message body in a single HTTP request. In this case, a sensing system can buffer multiple Observations and send them to a SensorThings service in one HTTP request. Here we propose an Action operation CreateObservations.


==== Request

Users can invoke the CreateObservations action by sending a HTTP POST request to the SERVICE_ROOT_URL/CreateObservations.

For example, http://example.org/v1.0/CreateObservations.

The message body aggregates Observations by Datastreams, which means all the Observations linked to one Datastream SHALL be aggregated in one JSON object. The parameters of each JSON object are shown in the following table.

As an Observation links to one FeatureOfInterest, to establish the link between an Observation and a FeatureOfInterest, users should include the FeatureOfInterest ids in the dataArray. If no FeatureOfInterest id presented, the FeatureOfInterest will be created based on the Location entities of the linked Thing entity by default.

To establish the link between an Observation and a FeatureOfInterest, the component name is "FeatureOfInterest/id" and the FeatureOfInterest ids should be included in the dataArray array. If no FeatureOfInterest id is presented, the FeatureOfInterest will be created based on the Location entities of the linked Thing entity by default.

==== Response

Upon successful completion the service SHALL respond with 201 Created. The response message body SHALL contain the URLs of the created Observation entities, where the order of URLs must match with the order of Observations in the dataArray from the request. In the case of the service having exceptions when creating individual observation entities, instead of responding with URLs, the service must specify "error" in the corresponding array element.
